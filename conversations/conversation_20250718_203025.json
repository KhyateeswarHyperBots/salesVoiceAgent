Given your experience with LLMs and transformer models in extracting data from invoices, I'm curious to know how you're currently handling financial document automation.\n\nSince the company's annual revenue isn't publicly disclosed, I'd like to explore other areas where Hyprbots can help streamline financial processes. Our Financial Document Automation solution, for instance, could help reduce manual data entry and improve accuracy in processing receipts, expense reports, and purchase orders.\n\nCan you tell me more about your current workflow for managing these types of documents? Are there any pain points or inefficiencies that you're struggling with? I'd love to understand your needs better and see how Hyprbots can help address them."
